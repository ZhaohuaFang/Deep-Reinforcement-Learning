[**Deep Reinforcement Learning.pdf**](https://github.com/ZhaohuaFang/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning.pdf) is what I made for helping you learn deep reinforcement learning, which includes fundamentals of RL, the idea of Q-learning and Deep Q-learning. Besides, [**Deep Reinforcement Learning.pdf**](https://github.com/ZhaohuaFang/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning.pdf) also covers SOTA algorithms like Actor-Critic model and Twin-Delayed DDPG(TD3). What should be mentioned is that all figures in [**Deep Reinforcement Learning.pdf**](https://github.com/ZhaohuaFang/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning.pdf) were got from Deep Reinforcement Learning 2.0 course provided by SuperDataScience Team on Udemy at [**Deep Reinforcement Learning 2.0**](https://www.udemy.com/share/102ZqoAEAfcFtbQ38J/).
